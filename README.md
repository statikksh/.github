 ##### Notice
 
As Linux was not running well as Desktop + *2.7GHZ*, *4GB RAM*, the project did not reach any of final goals due to hardware inability.
 
Statikk was done as a small experimental side-project ended in `June 27, 2020` when I was 16yo, a final version was not planned to be 100% user-friendly. 

So security issues are expected, all code is public and fully reusable for a rework.
